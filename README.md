# pdsl
dsl for specifying probability distributions

there really isn't anything here, yet. basically this is my playground for figuring out the best way to build a dsl that will allow users to specify things like:

x will almost always be between 65 and 129
when x goes up 10%, y will go up 15%

and more.
